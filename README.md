Tool to compare Debt Snowball vs Debt Avalanache approaches

Being in Debt is not fun.  It is stressful, frustrating and depressing.  When faced with more than one debt (i.e. multiple credit cards, lines of credit, Student Loans, Car Loans, etc) it can be hard to decide how to approach repayment.

There are two common repayment strategies.  Both require you to make minimum payments on all debts and then help you focus where to put your left over pay or other income (Garage sale receipts, odd jobs, Granny's gifts).

For both approaches you need to first itemize what is owing, minimum payments and what the interest rates are on each debt.  

This produces are chart like this:

|Debt Name      | Amount Owing  | Minimum Payment | Interest Rate |
| ------------- | -------------:| -----:|------:|
| Credit Card 1 | 11456.78 | 120.00 | 22.99% |
| Credit Card 2 |  3456.78 | 150.00 | 19.97% |
| Student Loan  | 75000.00 | 100.00 | 12.5%  |
| Car Loan      |  9000.00 | 180.00 |  5.6%  |

## Debt Snowball
The _Debt Snowball_ approach to debt repayment uses human psychology to boost success rates.  This method gets you to sort the debts by the "Amount Owing".  You then focus your attention on paying off the smallest balance first. This gives you a clear goal and,    Once the smallest debt is removed, you focus on the next smallest by "Amount Owing" and work to pay that one off.     .  



|Debt Name      | Amount Owing  | Minimum Payment | Interest Rate |
| ------------- | -------------:| -----:|------:|
| Credit Card 2 |  3456.78 | 150.00 | 19.97% |
| Car Loan      |  9000.00 | 180.00 |  5.6%  |
| Credit Card 1 | 11456.78 | 120.00 | 22.99% |
| Student Loan  | 75000.00 | 100.00 | 12.5%  |

This approach is not necessarily the least expensive, but it can be more successful because it gives clients a more immediate reward. This helps clients realize that progress is possible and reinforcies the desire to pay down more debt.

## Debt Avalanche
The _Debt Avalanche_ approach is a fastest/cheapest approach to paying down debts.  The Avalanche method ranks your debts by "Interest Rate".  Clients then focus on paying down the highest interest rate first.  By eliminating the highest interest debts first, you reduce the total paid out in interest and shorten the overall time spent paying off debts.

|Debt Name      | Amount Owing  | Minimum Payment | Interest Rate |
| ------------- | -------------:| -----:|------:|
| Credit Card 1 | 11456.78 | 120.00 | 22.99% |
| Credit Card 2 |  3456.78 | 150.00 | 19.97% |
| Student Loan  | 75000.00 | 100.00 | 12.5%  |
| Car Loan      |  9000.00 | 180.00 |  5.6%  |


This approach is the least expensive, but may lack the emotional boost that comes from a rapid payoff.
